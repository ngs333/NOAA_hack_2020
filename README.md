# NOAA_hack_2020
NOAA 2020 GPU Hackathon kernels used in a recent hackathon held virtually in December 2020.

This project contains derivative works from the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laborator](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/) GitHub projects for the [FV3 dynamical core](https://www.github.com/NOAA-GFDL/GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere) and the [FRE-NCtools](https://www.github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FRE-NCtools).  As such, licensing ascribed to those projects remains in effect and the original licensing restrictions and allowances are still applicable.
